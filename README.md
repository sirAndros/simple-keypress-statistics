About Project
=============

This is simple keylogger, working in background. On close it save statistic to file with random name in working dir.

I use it to determine which key I use more frequantly to decide if it worth to switch some `Key` and `Shift+Key`.

Originally I was inspired by description to [Universal Layout](https://github.com/tonsky/Universal-Layout), 
than I start own self-research and use for testing [this keyboar layouts](https://github.com/sirAndros/kbdasm).
