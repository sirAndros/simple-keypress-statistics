About Project
=============

This is simple keylogger, working in background. On close it save statistic to file with random name in working dir.

I use it to determine which key I use more frequently to decide if it worth to switch some `Key` and `Shift+Key`.

Originally I was inspired by description to [Universal Layout](https://github.com/tonsky/Universal-Layout),
than I've started research on own habits and use [this keyboard layouts](https://github.com/sirAndros/kbdasm).
